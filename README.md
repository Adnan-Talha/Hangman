# Hangman

A Hangman game is an interactive application that allows the user to play the classic word-guessing game. The goal of the game is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. The user has a limited number of guesses before a "hangman" figure is completed, resulting in a game over.

The game typically involves a user interface that displays a blank representation of the hidden word, and a text input fields that allow the user to guess a letter. As the user guesses letters, the application updates the display to reveal any occurrences of the guessed letter in the hidden word. If the user guesses incorrectly, a part of the hangman figure is drawn, with each incorrect guess adding another part until the figure is completed.

Overall, a Hangman game project using JavaScript is a fun,engaging,classic and an entertaining game for users to enjoy.
